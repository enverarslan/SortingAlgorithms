# SortingAlgorithms
Implementing Sorting Algorithms with C Programming Language.

Counting comparions and swaps, analyzing for already sorted(ascending and descending) arrays.

Note: Using big sized array may cause memory allocation and segmentation fault errors.
Because some algorithms use recursion and these codes not writing for production. Its all about learning.
